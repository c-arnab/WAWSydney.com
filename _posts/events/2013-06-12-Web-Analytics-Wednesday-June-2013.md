Web Analytics Wednesday is on **Wednesday** 12th June.

#### Talks

*	**Media Attribution**

	_[David Brigham](http://www.aegismedia.com.au), Head of Web Analytics at Aegis Media_

	Everybody knows that media attribution is the holy grail of digital marketing. Or at least it would be if it wasn't for a few .teething problems.. This presentation goes into the reasons why you should always caveat attribution analysis, and the reasons why not doing attribution is worse.

*	**Data layer standard**

	_[Simon Rumble](http://simonrumble.com/), Independent digital analytics bloke_

	A [standardization process](http://www.w3.org/community/custexpdata/wiki/Main_Page) is underway for an abstraction layer to sit between your site and any analytics tools that need to use it. It will bring many benefits including easier implementations, ability to switch between vendors and consistent reporting.
